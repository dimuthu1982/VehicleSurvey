Assumptions

1.	Vehicles only travel sequentially
2.	The distance between two axles is 2.5m
3.  Down stream, only line A is calculated
4.	Statistical data only feeds in Milliseconds
5.	Morning session is limited to 8AM to 11.59 and evening 12 - 4.59
6.	Survey data file only contains one day
7.	Survey data format and patters are accurate
8.  Survey file name is "Vehicle Survey Coding Challenge sample data.txt" and expect to be located in the resource folder.



Further Improvements

1.	Replace System.out with logger
2.	Adopt Dependency Injection

Solution:
1. Uses Java8, Junit4, Buildr and collector diign patterns with OOP concepts
2. The file should be located under src\main\resources folder by the name "Vehicle Survey Coding Challenge sample data.txt"
